                        Hi there, you made it!  I hope it wasn't too hard to get here.  Did the person that directed you here give you the relative path or a direct path (coding reference)?  Well... alright! You're probably wondering where HERE is, what THIS is... let me answer those questions for you. Right NOW! You are here because you are looking for the best web developer (pssstt -- I am talking about me 😏 ) and this is my website. Feel free to browse around. </p>
                    <p>If you want to see what I am made of... I recommend checking out the "Portfolio" section. It's really cool and I worked my tail off.</p>
                    <p>If you like what you see, go to the "Contact" section and drop me a line. I would be happy to help out on some website or develop an app for you.  HAVE FUN and I will chat with you later!!!</p>
